# TSP_Heuristic_Exact_solution

In this repository I’m going to analyze the problem of drilling boards and in particular
how to optimize the production time in term of path to follow in order
to drill a board. 
On that problem I will propose two different approaches, an
exact optimization method and an approximation algorithm, depending on the
situation one could prefer one or the other. 
For completeness I will underline
the advantages and disadvantages of the first and second approch respectively,
it will be a company’s task to decide in which way solve its problem.
